👋 Hello, I’m Jamy
I’m currently a student at Esisar, part of the Grenoble INP engineering schools in France, with a strong background in embedded systems, digital design, and software development.

💡 What I do
I’m passionate about building and learning. Some of the areas I work on include:

🌱 Designing smart embedded systems (e.g., an automated greenhouse with Arduino and sensors)
🔧 Digital design using Verilog and FPGA (Basys 3)
💻 Developing websites using Hugo, Markdown, Git, and Linux
🧠 Always learning: I enjoy diving into algorithms, microcontrollers, and system-level programming
